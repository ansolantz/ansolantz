## Hi I'm Anso 

‚ú® **A Flutter developer with a frontend passion**‚ú®

*I am a detail-oriented frontend developer with a deep appreciation for creating user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces. My strongest focus is on working with Design Systems - creating, building, and maintaining reusable components that drive consistency and scalability.*

I have long experience as a front-end developer using various technologies but for the last years, I am focusing entirely on Flutter which I am very passionate about.

My specialty lies at the intersection of Design and Engineering and in my most recent positions I
have, among other things, led the development of two large scale Flutter Design Systems from the
ground up. Ensuring that both the look and the feel are consistent and intuitive across all
components in the app.
 
I'm passionate about:

- üíª Flutter - Creating clean, maintainable code that drive consistency and scalability.
- üå± Learning new things
- üèã Healt & weellbeeing
- üåé Travel the world
